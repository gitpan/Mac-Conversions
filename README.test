The image included here for testing should be demacbinarized before 
testing.  If you use Chris Nandor's untargzipme.plx and MacPerl to unpack 
this archive, it should be that way when you read this.  Otherwise, use any 
MacBinary decoder to decode this before testing, and then move the 
original .bin file from the testfiles folder.

This particular picture was chosen because it caught a couple of bugs while 
Eryq was developing Convert::BinHex.  It's the famous "Earthrise" picture 
from Apollo 8.
