7/15/99  Version 1.02
Fixed stupid 1.01 packaging error.  Put line in Makefile.PL to warn against 
using this anywhere but MacPerl.  Fixed the comparison routine in test.pl so
that it will actually work on 68k machines, by skipping the reserved first
128 bytes of the resource fork.

5/18/99 Version 1.01

Changed macbinary decoding routines to croak when files smaller than 128
bytes are fed to them.  Since the header must be 128 bytes in length, the
file must be corrupt if it doesn't have at least this many bytes.  Added
two tests to test for this by trying to decode an empty file.
